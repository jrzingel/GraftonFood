Grafton Food 🍔
---------------

In order to keep up with the ever changing FlameTree menu, sometimes my friends and I would miss out on our favourite meals. This wouldn’t do, so this app shows the menu for Grafton Hall everyday. 

The widget on the Home Screen automatically updates to the next meal, and the main app allows you to select any day and see what the meal is. With this app we’ve always been able to make sure we don’t miss our favourite meals

Also includes dark mode  🌙
